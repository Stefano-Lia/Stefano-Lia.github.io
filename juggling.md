As usual nowadays, also about the mathematics of juggling there are thousands of sources, and no real need for a new one repeating stuff you can find elsewhere. 
Still, somebody could make use of a guide on how to move around the sources.  In this page I will collect things about juggling, for my own pleasure and maybe for the benefit of who doesn't already know that much about it and its connections with mathematics.
